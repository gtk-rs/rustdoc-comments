<!-- struct Action -->
`Action` should be implemented by instances of `Object` classes
with which the user can interact directly, i.e. buttons,
checkboxes, scrollbars, e.g. components which are not "passive"
providers of UI information.

Exceptions: when the user interaction is already covered by another
appropriate interface such as `EditableText` (insert/delete text,
etc.) or `Value` (set value) then these actions should not be
exposed by `Action` as well.

Though most UI interactions on components should be invocable via
keyboard as well as mouse, there will generally be a close mapping
between "mouse actions" that are possible on a component and the
AtkActions. Where mouse and keyboard actions are redundant in
effect, `Action` should expose only one action rather than
exposing redundant actions if possible. By convention we have been
using "mouse centric" terminology for `Action` names.

# Implements

[`AtkActionExt`](trait.AtkActionExt.html)
<!-- trait AtkActionExt -->
Trait containing all `Action` methods.

# Implementors

[`Action`](struct.Action.html), [`Hyperlink`](struct.Hyperlink.html), [`NoOpObject`](struct.NoOpObject.html)
<!-- trait AtkActionExt::fn do_action -->
Perform the specified action on the object.
## `i`
the action index corresponding to the action to be performed

# Returns

`true` if success, `false` otherwise
<!-- trait AtkActionExt::fn get_description -->
Returns a description of the specified action of the object.
## `i`
the action index corresponding to the action to be performed

# Returns

a description string, or `None` if `self` does
not implement this interface.
<!-- trait AtkActionExt::fn get_keybinding -->
Gets the keybinding which can be used to activate this action, if one
exists. The string returned should contain localized, human-readable,
key sequences as they would appear when displayed on screen. It must
be in the format "mnemonic;sequence;shortcut".

- The mnemonic key activates the object if it is presently enabled onscreen.
 This typically corresponds to the underlined letter within the widget.
 Example: "n" in a traditional "New..." menu item or the "a" in "Apply" for
 a button.
- The sequence is the full list of keys which invoke the action even if the
 relevant element is not currently shown on screen. For instance, for a menu
 item the sequence is the keybindings used to open the parent menus before
 invoking. The sequence string is colon-delimited. Example: "Alt+F:N" in a
 traditional "New..." menu item.
- The shortcut, if it exists, will invoke the same action without showing
 the component or its enclosing menus or dialogs. Example: "Ctrl+N" in a
 traditional "New..." menu item.

Example: For a traditional "New..." menu item, the expected return value
would be: "N;Alt+F:N;Ctrl+N" for the English locale and "N;Alt+D:N;Strg+N"
for the German locale. If, hypothetically, this menu item lacked a mnemonic,
it would be represented by ";;Ctrl+N" and ";;Strg+N" respectively.
## `i`
the action index corresponding to the action to be performed

# Returns

the keybinding which can be used to activate
this action, or `None` if there is no keybinding for this action.
<!-- trait AtkActionExt::fn get_localized_name -->
Returns the localized name of the specified action of the object.
## `i`
the action index corresponding to the action to be performed

# Returns

a name string, or `None` if `self` does not
implement this interface.
<!-- trait AtkActionExt::fn get_n_actions -->
Gets the number of accessible actions available on the object.
If there are more than one, the first one is considered the
"default" action of the object.

# Returns

a the number of actions, or 0 if `self` does not
implement this interface.
<!-- trait AtkActionExt::fn get_name -->
Returns a non-localized string naming the specified action of the
object. This name is generally not descriptive of the end result
of the action, but instead names the 'interaction type' which the
object supports. By convention, the above strings should be used to
represent the actions which correspond to the common point-and-click
interaction techniques of the same name: i.e.
"click", "press", "release", "drag", "drop", "popup", etc.
The "popup" action should be used to pop up a context menu for the
object, if one exists.

For technical reasons, some toolkits cannot guarantee that the
reported action is actually 'bound' to a nontrivial user event;
i.e. the result of some actions via `Action::do_action` may be
NIL.
## `i`
the action index corresponding to the action to be performed

# Returns

a name string, or `None` if `self` does not
implement this interface.
<!-- trait AtkActionExt::fn set_description -->
Sets a description of the specified action of the object.
## `i`
the action index corresponding to the action to be performed
## `desc`
the description to be assigned to this action

# Returns

a gboolean representing if the description was successfully set;
<!-- struct Attribute -->
AtkAttribute is a string name/value pair representing a generic
attribute. This can be used to expose additional information from
an accessible object as a whole (see `AtkObjectExt::get_attributes`)
or an document (see `Document::get_attributes`). In the case of
text attributes (see `Text::get_default_attributes`),
`TextAttribute` enum defines all the possible text attribute
names. You can use `TextAttribute::get_name` to get the string
name from the enum value. See also `TextAttribute::for_name`
and `TextAttribute::get_value` for more information.

A string name/value pair representing a generic attribute.
<!-- impl Attribute::fn set_free -->
Frees the memory used by an `AttributeSet`, including all its
`AtkAttributes`.
## `attrib_set`
The `AttributeSet` to free
<!-- struct Component -->
`Component` should be implemented by most if not all UI elements
with an actual on-screen presence, i.e. components which can be
said to have a screen-coordinate bounding box. Virtually all
widgets will need to have `Component` implementations provided
for their corresponding `Object` class. In short, only UI
elements which are *not* GUI elements will omit this ATK interface.

A possible exception might be textual information with a
transparent background, in which case text glyph bounding box
information is provided by `Text`.

<!-- struct Document -->
The AtkDocument interface should be supported by any object whose
content is a representation or view of a document. The AtkDocument
interface should appear on the toplevel container for the document
content; however AtkDocument instances may be nested (i.e. an
AtkDocument may be a descendant of another AtkDocument) in those
cases where one document contains "embedded content" which can
reasonably be considered a document in its own right.

# Implements

<!-- trait DocumentExt -->
Trait containing all `Document` methods.

# Implementors

[`Document`](struct.Document.html), [`NoOpObject`](struct.NoOpObject.html)
<!-- trait DocumentExt::fn get_attribute_value -->
## `attribute_name`

 whose value is being queried.

# Returns

a string value associated with the named
 attribute for this document, or NULL if a value for
 `attribute_name` has not been specified for this document.
<!-- trait DocumentExt::fn get_attributes -->
Gets an AtkAttributeSet which describes document-wide
 attributes as name-value pairs.

# Returns

An AtkAttributeSet containing the explicitly
 set name-value-pair attributes associated with this document
 as a whole.

# Returns

current page number inside `self`. -1 if not
implemented, not know by the implementor or irrelevant.
<!-- trait DocumentExt::fn get_document -->
Gets a `gpointer` that points to an instance of the DOM. It is
up to the caller to check atk_document_get_type to determine
how to cast this pointer.

the document. Use it directly, or one of its children, as an
instance of the DOM.

# Returns

a `gpointer` that points to an instance of the DOM.
<!-- trait DocumentExt::fn get_document_type -->

 whose value is being set.
## `attribute_value`
a string value to be associated with `attribute_name`.

# Returns

TRUE if `value` is successfully associated with `attribute_name`
 for this document, FALSE otherwise (e.g. if the document does not
 allow the attribute to be modified).
<!-- trait DocumentExt::fn connect_load_complete -->
The 'load-complete' signal is emitted when a pending load of
a static document has completed. This signal is to be
expected by ATK clients if and when AtkDocument implementors
expose ATK_STATE_BUSY. If the state of an AtkObject which
implements AtkDocument does not include ATK_STATE_BUSY, it
should be safe for clients to assume that the AtkDocument's
static contents are fully loaded into the container.
(Dynamic document contents should be exposed via other
signals.)
<!-- trait DocumentExt::fn connect_load_stopped -->
The 'load-stopped' signal is emitted when a pending load of
document contents is cancelled, paused, or otherwise
interrupted by the user or application logic. It should not
however be emitted while waiting for a resource (for instance
while blocking on a file or network read) unless a
user-significant timeout has occurred.
<!-- trait DocumentExt::fn connect_page_changed -->
The 'page-changed' signal is emitted when the current page of
a document changes, e.g. pressing page up/down in a document
viewer.
## `page_number`
the new page number. If this value is unknown
or not applicable, -1 should be provided.
<!-- trait DocumentExt::fn connect_reload -->
The 'reload' signal is emitted when the contents of a
document is refreshed from its source. Once 'reload' has
been emitted, a matching 'load-complete' or 'load-stopped'
signal should follow, which clients may await before
interrogating ATK for the latest document content.
<!-- struct EditableText -->
`EditableText` should be implemented by UI components which
contain text which the user can edit, via the `Object`
corresponding to that component (see `Object`).

`EditableText` is a subclass of `Text`, and as such, an object
which implements `EditableText` is by definition an `Text`
implementor as well.

<!-- struct Hyperlink -->
An ATK object which encapsulates a link or set of links (for
instance in the case of client-side image maps) in a hypertext
document. It may implement the AtkAction interface. AtkHyperlink
may also be used to refer to inline embedded content, since it
allows specification of a start and end offset within the host
AtkHypertext object.

<!-- trait HyperlinkExt::fn get_n_anchors -->
Gets the number of anchors associated with this hyperlink.

# Returns

the number of anchors associated with this hyperlink
<!-- trait HyperlinkExt::fn get_object -->
Returns the item associated with this hyperlinks nth anchor.
For instance, the returned `Object` will implement `Text`
if `self` is a text hyperlink, `Image` if `self` is an image
hyperlink etc.

Multiple anchors are primarily used by client-side image maps.
## `i`
a (zero-index) integer specifying the desired anchor

# Returns

an `Object` associated with this hyperlinks
i-th anchor
<!-- trait HyperlinkExt::fn get_start_index -->
Gets the index with the hypertext document at which this link begins.

a (zero-index) integer specifying the desired anchor

# Returns

<!-- trait HyperlinkExt::fn is_inline -->
Indicates whether the link currently displays some or all of its
 content inline. Ordinary HTML links will usually return
 `false`, but an inline &lt;src&gt; HTML element will return
 `true`.

# Returns

whether or not this link displays its content inline.
<!-- trait HyperlinkExt::fn is_valid -->
Since the document that a link is associated with may have changed
this method returns `true` if the link is still valid (with
respect to the document it references) and `false` otherwise.

# Returns

whether or not this link is still valid
<!-- trait HyperlinkExt::fn connect_link_activated -->
The signal link-activated is emitted when a link is activated.
<!-- struct HyperlinkImpl -->
AtkHyperlinkImpl allows AtkObjects to refer to their associated
AtkHyperlink instance, if one exists. AtkHyperlinkImpl differs
from AtkHyperlink in that AtkHyperlinkImpl is an interface, whereas
AtkHyperlink is a object type. The AtkHyperlinkImpl interface
allows a client to query an AtkObject for the availability of an
associated AtkHyperlink instance, and obtain that instance. It is
thus particularly useful in cases where embedded content or inline
content within a text object is present, since the embedding text
object implements AtkHypertext and the inline/embedded objects are
exposed as children which implement AtkHyperlinkImpl, in addition
to their being obtainable via AtkHypertext:getLink followed by
AtkHyperlink:getObject.

The AtkHyperlinkImpl interface should be supported by objects
exposed within the hierarchy as children of an AtkHypertext
container which correspond to "links" or embedded content within
the text. HTML anchors are not, for instance, normally exposed
this way, but embedded images and components which appear inline in
the content of a text object are. The AtkHyperlinkIface interface
allows a means of determining which children are hyperlinks in this
sense of the word, and for obtaining their corresponding
AtkHyperlink object, from which the embedding range, URI, etc. can
be obtained.

To some extent this interface exists because, for historical
reasons, AtkHyperlink was defined as an object type, not an
interface. Thus, in order to interact with AtkObjects via
AtkHyperlink semantics, a new interface was required.

<!-- struct Hypertext -->
An interface used for objects which implement linking between
multiple resource or content locations, or multiple 'markers'
within a single document. A Hypertext instance is associated with
one or more Hyperlinks, which are associated with particular
offsets within the Hypertext's included content. While this
interface is derived from Text, there is no requirement that
Hypertext instances have textual content; they may implement Image
as well, and Hyperlinks need not have non-zero text offsets.

The "link-selected" signal is emitted by an AtkHyperText
object when one of the hyperlinks associated with the object
is selected.
## `arg1`
the index of the hyperlink which is selected
<!-- struct Image -->
`Image` should be implemented by `Object` subtypes on behalf of
components which display image/pixmap information onscreen, and
which provide information (other than just widget borders, etc.)
via that image content. For instance, icons, buttons with icons,
toolbar elements, and image viewing panes typically should
implement `Image`.

`Image` primarily provides two types of information: coordinate
information (useful for screen review mode of screenreaders, and
for use by onscreen magnifiers), and descriptive information. The
descriptive information is provided for alternative, text-only
presentation of the most significant information present in the
image.

services ATK requests, since fulfilling ATK requests often
requires calling into the GUI toolkit. If a long-running or
potentially blocking call takes place inside such a block, it should
be bracketed by atk_misc_threads_leave/atk_misc_threads_enter calls.
(This method is implemented by the toolkit ATK implementation layer;
 for instance, for GTK+, GAIL implements this via GDK_THREADS_LEAVE).

# Deprecated

Since 2.12.
<!-- struct NoOpObject -->
An AtkNoOpObject is an AtkObject which purports to implement all
ATK interfaces. It is the type of AtkObject which is created if an
accessible object is requested for an object type for which no
factory type is specified.

# Implements

<!-- impl NoOpObjectFactory::fn new -->
Creates an instance of an `ObjectFactory` which generates primitive
(non-functioning) `AtkObjects`.

# Returns

an instance of an `ObjectFactory`
<!-- struct Object -->
This class is the primary class for accessibility support via the
Accessibility ToolKit (ATK). Objects which are instances of
`Object` (or instances of AtkObject-derived types) are queried
for properties which relate basic (and generic) properties of a UI
component such as name and description. Instances of `Object`
may also be queried as to whether they implement other ATK
interfaces (e.g. `Action`, `Component`, etc.), as appropriate
to the role which a given UI component plays in a user interface.

All UI components in an application which provide useful
information or services to the user must provide corresponding
`Object` instances on request (in GTK+, for instance, usually on
a call to `gtk_widget_get_accessible` ()), either via ATK support
built into the toolkit for the widget class or ancestor class, or
in the case of custom widgets, if the inherited `Object`
implementation is insufficient, via instances of a new `Object`
subclass.

See also: `ObjectFactory`, `Registry`. (GTK+ users see also
``GtkAccessible``).

<!-- trait AtkObjectExt::fn get_attributes -->
Get a list of properties applied to this object as a whole, as an `AttributeSet` consisting of
name-value pairs. As such these attributes may be considered weakly-typed properties or annotations,
as distinct from strongly-typed object data available via other get/set methods.
Not all objects have explicit "name-value pair" `AttributeSet` properties.

# Returns

an `AttributeSet` consisting of all
explicit properties/annotations applied to the object, or an empty

a UTF-8 string indicating the POSIX-style LC_MESSAGES
 locale of `self`.
<!-- trait AtkObjectExt::fn get_parent -->
Gets the accessible parent of the accessible. By default this is
the one assigned with `AtkObjectExt::set_parent`, but it is assumed
that ATK implementors have ways to get the parent of the object
without the need of assigning it manually with
`AtkObjectExt::set_parent`, and will return it with this method.

further reference.

# Returns

an `Object` representing the accessible
parent of the accessible if assigned
<!-- trait AtkObjectExt::fn ref_accessible_child -->

<!-- trait AtkObjectExt::fn set_description -->
Sets the accessible description of the accessible. You can't set
the description to NULL. This is reserved for the initial value. In
this aspect NULL is similar to ATK_ROLE_UNKNOWN. If you want to set
the name to a empty value you can use "".
## `description`
a character string to be set as the accessible description
<!-- trait AtkObjectExt::fn set_name -->
Sets the accessible name of the accessible. You can't set the name
to NULL. This is reserved for the initial value. In this aspect
NULL is similar to ATK_ROLE_UNKNOWN. If you want to set the name to
a empty value you can use "".

<!-- trait AtkObjectExt::fn connect_active_descendant_changed -->
The "active-descendant-changed" signal is emitted by an object
which has the state ATK_STATE_MANAGES_DESCENDANTS when the focus
object in the object changes. For instance, a table will emit the
signal when the cell in the table which has focus changes.
## `arg1`
the newly focused object.
<!-- trait AtkObjectExt::fn connect_children_changed -->
The signal "children-changed" is emitted when a child is added or
removed form an object. It supports two details: "add" and
"remove"
## `arg1`

-1. This is used if the value is not known by the implementor
when the child is added/removed or irrelevant.
## `arg2`
A gpointer to the child AtkObject which was added or
removed. If the child was removed, it is possible that it is not
available for the implementor. In that case this pointer can be
NULL.
<!-- trait AtkObjectExt::fn connect_property_change -->
The signal "property-change" is emitted when an object's property
value changes. `arg1` contains an `PropertyValues` with the name
and the new value of the property whose value has changed. Note
that, as with GObject notify, getting this signal does not
guarantee that the value of the property has actually changed; it
may also be emitted when the setter of the property is called to
reinstate the previous value.

Toolkit implementor note: ATK implementors should use
`gobject::ObjectExt::notify` to emit property-changed
notifications. `Object::property-changed` is needed by the
implementation of `atk_add_global_event_listener` because GObject
notify doesn't support emission hooks.
## `arg1`
an `PropertyValues` containing the new
value of the property which changed.
<!-- trait AtkObjectExt::fn connect_state_change -->
The "state-change" signal is emitted when an object's state
changes. The detail value identifies the state type which has
changed.
## `arg1`
The name of the state which has changed
## `arg2`
A boolean which indicates whether the state has been set or unset.
<!-- trait AtkObjectExt::fn connect_visible_data_changed -->
The "visible-data-changed" signal is emitted when the visual
appearance of the object changed.

accessibles. When called, `self` may need to inform
`AtkObjects` which it has created that they need to be re-instantiated.
Note: primarily used for runtime replacement of `AtkObjectFactorys`
in object registries.
<!-- struct Plug -->
See `Socket`

[`Plug`](struct.Plug.html)
<!-- trait AtkPlugExt::fn get_id -->
Gets the unique ID of an `Plug` object, which can be used to
embed inside of an `Socket` using `AtkSocketExt::embed`.

Internally, this calls a class function that should be registered
by the IPC layer (usually at-spi2-atk). The implementor of an
`Plug` object should call this function (after atk-bridge is
loaded) and pass the value to the process implementing the
`Socket`, so it could embed the plug.

# Returns

the unique ID for the plug
<!-- struct Range -->
`Range` are used on `Value`, in order to represent the full
range of a given component (for example an slider or a range

A data structure for holding a rectangle. Those coordinates are
relative to the component top-level parent.
<!-- struct Registry -->
The AtkRegistry is normally used to create appropriate ATK "peers"
for user interface components. Application developers usually need
only interact with the AtkRegistry by associating appropriate ATK
implementation classes with GObject classes via the
atk_registry_set_factory_type call, passing the appropriate GType
for application custom widget classes.

controlled by other components, share group membership with other
components (for instance within a radio-button group), or share
content which "flows" between them, among other types of possible
relationships.

# Implements

Indicates an object is a label for one or more target objects.
<!-- enum RelationType::variant LabelledBy -->
Indicates an object is labelled by one or more target objects.
<!-- enum RelationType::variant MemberOf -->
Indicates an object is a member of a group of one or more target objects.
<!-- enum RelationType::variant NodeChildOf -->
Indicates an object is a cell in a treetable which is displayed because a cell in the same column is expanded and identifies that cell.
<!-- enum RelationType::variant FlowsTo -->
Indicates that the object has content that flows logically to another
 AtkObject in a sequential way, (for instance text-flow).
<!-- enum RelationType::variant FlowsFrom -->
Indicates that the object has content that flows logically from
 another AtkObject in a sequential way, (for instance text-flow).
<!-- enum RelationType::variant SubwindowOf -->
Indicates a subwindow attached to a component but otherwise has no connection in the UI heirarchy to that component.
<!-- enum RelationType::variant Embeds -->
Indicates that the object visually embeds
 another object's content, i.e. this object's content flows around
 another's content.
<!-- enum RelationType::variant EmbeddedBy -->
Reciprocal of `RelationType::Embeds`, indicates that
 this object's content is visualy embedded in another object.
<!-- enum RelationType::variant PopupFor -->
Indicates that an object is a popup for another object.
<!-- enum RelationType::variant ParentWindowOf -->
Indicates that an object is a parent window of another object.
<!-- enum RelationType::variant DescribedBy -->
Reciprocal of `RelationType::DescriptionFor`. Indicates that one
or more target objects provide descriptive information about this object. This relation
type is most appropriate for information that is not essential as its presentation may
be user-configurable and/or limited to an on-demand mechanism such as an assistive
technology command. For brief, essential information such as can be found in a widget's
on-screen label, use `RelationType::LabelledBy`. For an on-screen error message, use
`RelationType::ErrorMessage`. For lengthy extended descriptive information contained in
an on-screen object, consider using `RelationType::Details` as assistive technologies may
provide a means for the user to navigate to objects containing detailed descriptions so
that their content can be more closely reviewed.
<!-- enum RelationType::variant DescriptionFor -->
Reciprocal of `RelationType::DescribedBy`. Indicates that this
object provides descriptive information about the target object(s). See also
`RelationType::DetailsFor` and `RelationType::ErrorFor`.
<!-- enum RelationType::variant NodeParentOf -->
Indicates an object is a cell in a treetable and is expanded to display other cells in the same column.
<!-- enum RelationType::variant Details -->
Reciprocal of `RelationType::DetailsFor`. Indicates that this object
has a detailed or extended description, the contents of which can be found in the target
object(s). This relation type is most appropriate for information that is sufficiently
lengthy as to make navigation to the container of that information desirable. For less
verbose information suitable for announcement only, see `RelationType::DescribedBy`. If
the detailed information describes an error condition, `RelationType::ErrorFor` should be
used instead. `Since`: ATK-2.26.
<!-- enum RelationType::variant DetailsFor -->
Reciprocal of `RelationType::Details`. Indicates that this object
provides a detailed or extended description about the target object(s). See also
`RelationType::DescriptionFor` and `RelationType::ErrorFor`. `Since`: ATK-2.26.
<!-- enum RelationType::variant ErrorMessage -->
Reciprocal of `RelationType::ErrorFor`. Indicates that this object
has one or more errors, the nature of which is described in the contents of the target
object(s). Objects that have this relation type should also contain `StateType::InvalidEntry`
in their `StateSet`. `Since`: ATK-2.26.
<!-- enum RelationType::variant ErrorFor -->
Reciprocal of `RelationType::ErrorMessage`. Indicates that this object
contains an error message describing an invalid condition in the target object(s). `Since`:
ATK_2.26.
<!-- enum RelationType::variant LastDefined -->
Not used, this value indicates the end of the enumeration.
<!-- enum Role -->
Describes the role of an object

These are the built-in enumerated roles that UI components can have in
ATK. Other roles may be added at runtime, so an AtkRole >=
ATK_ROLE_LAST_DEFINED is not necessarily an error.

<!-- enum Role::variant Static -->
A generic non-container object whose purpose is to display a
brief amount of information to the user and whose role is known by the
implementor but lacks semantic value for the user. Examples in which
ATK_ROLE_STATIC is appropriate include the message displayed in a message box
and an image used as an alternative means to display text. ATK_ROLE_STATIC
should not be applied to widgets which are traditionally interactive, objects
which display a significant amount of content, or any object which has an
accessible relation pointing to another object. Implementors should expose the
displayed information through the accessible name of the object. If doing so seems
inappropriate, it may indicate that a different role should be used. For
labels which describe another widget, see ATK_ROLE_LABEL. For text views, see
ATK_ROLE_TEXT. For generic containers, see ATK_ROLE_PANEL. For objects whose
role is not known by the implementor, see ATK_ROLE_UNKNOWN. `Since`: ATK-2.16.

<!-- struct Selection -->
`Selection` should be implemented by UI components with children
which are exposed by `atk_object_ref_child` and
`atk_object_get_n_children`, if the use of the parent UI component
ordinarily involves selection of one or more of the objects
corresponding to those `Object` children - for example,
selectable lists.

Note that other types of "selection" (for instance text selection)
are accomplished a other ATK interfaces - `Selection` is limited
to the selection/deselection of children.

# Implements

[`SelectionExt`](trait.SelectionExt.html)
<!-- trait SelectionExt -->
Trait containing all `Selection` methods.

# Implementors

[`NoOpObject`](struct.NoOpObject.html), [`Selection`](struct.Selection.html)

Clears the selection in the object so that no children in the object
are selected.

# Returns

TRUE if success, FALSE otherwise.
<!-- trait SelectionExt::fn get_selection_count -->
Gets the number of accessible children currently selected.
Note: callers should not rely on `None` or on a zero value for
indication of whether AtkSelectionIface is implemented, they should
use type checking/interface checking macros or the
`atk_get_accessible_value` convenience method.

# Returns

a gint representing the number of items selected, or 0
if `self` does not implement this interface.
<!-- trait SelectionExt::fn is_child_selected -->
Determines if the current child of this object is selected
Note: callers should not rely on `None` or on a zero value for
indication of whether AtkSelectionIface is implemented, they should
use type checking/interface checking macros or the
`atk_get_accessible_value` convenience method.
## `i`
a `gint` specifying the child index.

# Returns

a gboolean representing the specified child is selected, or 0
if `self` does not implement this interface.
<!-- trait SelectionExt::fn ref_selection -->
Gets a reference to the accessible object representing the specified
selected child of the object.
Note: callers should not rely on `None` or on a zero value for
indication of whether AtkSelectionIface is implemented, they should
use type checking/interface checking macros or the
`atk_get_accessible_value` convenience method.
## `i`
a `gint` specifying the index in the selection set. (e.g. the
ith selection as opposed to the ith child).

# Returns

an `Object` representing the
selected accessible, or `None` if `self` does not implement this
interface.
<!-- trait SelectionExt::fn remove_selection -->

<!-- trait SelectionExt::fn select_all_selection -->
Causes every child of the object to be selected if the object
supports multiple selections.

# Returns

TRUE if success, FALSE otherwise.
<!-- trait SelectionExt::fn connect_selection_changed -->
The "selection-changed" signal is emitted by an object which
implements AtkSelection interface when the selection changes.
<!-- struct Socket -->
Together with `Plug`, `Socket` provides the ability to embed
accessibles from one process into another in a fashion that is
transparent to assistive technologies. `Socket` works as the
container of `Plug`, embedding it using the method
`AtkSocketExt::embed`. Any accessible contained in the `Plug` will
appear to the assistive technologies as being inside the
application that created the `Socket`.

The communication between a `Socket` and a `Plug` is done by
the IPC layer of the accessibility framework, normally implemented
by the D-Bus based implementation of AT-SPI (at-spi2). If that is
the case, at-spi-atk2 is the responsible to implement the abstract
methods `AtkPlugExt::get_id` and `AtkSocketExt::embed`, so an ATK
implementor shouldn't reimplement them. The process that contains
the `Plug` is responsible to send the ID returned by
`atk_plug_id` to the process that contains the `Socket`, so it
could call the method `AtkSocketExt::embed` in order to embed it.

For the same reasons, an implementor doesn't need to implement
`AtkObjectExt::get_n_accessible_children` and
`AtkObjectExt::ref_accessible_child`. All the logic related to those
functions will be implemented by the IPC layer.

# Implements

[`AtkSocketExt`](trait.AtkSocketExt.html), [`AtkObjectExt`](trait.AtkObjectExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html), [`ComponentExt`](trait.ComponentExt.html)
<!-- trait AtkSocketExt -->
Trait containing all `Socket` methods.

# Implementors

[`Socket`](struct.Socket.html)
<!-- trait AtkSocketExt::fn embed -->
Embeds the children of an `Plug` as the children of the
`Socket`. The plug may be in the same process or in a different
process.

The class item used by this function should be filled in by the IPC
layer (usually at-spi2-atk). The implementor of the AtkSocket
should call this function and pass the id for the plug as returned
by `AtkPlugExt::get_id`. It is the responsibility of the application
to pass the plug id on to the process implementing the `Socket`
as needed.
## `plug_id`
the ID of an `Plug`
<!-- trait AtkSocketExt::fn is_occupied -->
Determines whether or not the socket has an embedded plug.

# Returns

TRUE if a plug is embedded in the socket
<!-- struct StateSet -->
An AtkStateSet is a read-only representation of the full set of `AtkStates`
that apply to an object at a given time. This set is not meant to be
modified, but rather created when `AtkObjectExt::ref_state_set`() is called.

# Implements

[`StateSetExt`](trait.StateSetExt.html), [`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- trait StateSetExt -->
Trait containing all `StateSet` methods.

# Implementors

[`StateSet`](struct.StateSet.html)
<!-- impl StateSet::fn new -->
Creates a new empty state set.

# Returns

a new `StateSet`
<!-- trait StateSetExt::fn add_state -->
Adds the state of the specified type to the state set if it is not already
present.

Note that because an `StateSet` is a read-only object, this method should
be used to add a state to a newly-created set which will then be returned by
`AtkObjectExt::ref_state_set`. It should not be used to modify the existing state
of an object. See also `AtkObjectExt::notify_state_change`.
## `type_`
an `StateType`

# Returns

`true` if the state for `type_` is not already in `self`.
<!-- trait StateSetExt::fn add_states -->
Adds the states of the specified types to the state set.

Note that because an `StateSet` is a read-only object, this method should
be used to add states to a newly-created set which will then be returned by
`AtkObjectExt::ref_state_set`. It should not be used to modify the existing state
of an object. See also `AtkObjectExt::notify_state_change`.
## `types`
an array of `StateType`
## `n_types`
The number of elements in the array
<!-- trait StateSetExt::fn and_sets -->
Constructs the intersection of the two sets, returning `None` if the
intersection is empty.
## `compare_set`
another `StateSet`

# Returns

a new `StateSet` which is the intersection of
the two sets.
<!-- trait StateSetExt::fn clear_states -->
Removes all states from the state set.
<!-- trait StateSetExt::fn contains_state -->
Checks whether the state for the specified type is in the specified set.
## `type_`
an `StateType`

# Returns

`true` if `type_` is the state type is in `self`.
<!-- trait StateSetExt::fn contains_states -->
Checks whether the states for all the specified types are in the
specified set.
## `types`
an array of `StateType`
## `n_types`
The number of elements in the array

# Returns

`true` if all the states for `type_` are in `self`.
<!-- trait StateSetExt::fn is_empty -->
Checks whether the state set is empty, i.e. has no states set.

# Returns

`true` if `self` has no states set, otherwise `false`
<!-- trait StateSetExt::fn or_sets -->
Constructs the union of the two sets.
## `compare_set`
another `StateSet`

# Returns

a new `StateSet` which is
the union of the two sets, returning `None` is empty.
<!-- trait StateSetExt::fn remove_state -->
Removes the state for the specified type from the state set.

Note that because an `StateSet` is a read-only object, this method should
be used to remove a state to a newly-created set which will then be returned
by `AtkObjectExt::ref_state_set`. It should not be used to modify the existing
state of an object. See also `AtkObjectExt::notify_state_change`.
## `type_`
an `AtkType`

# Returns

`true` if `type_` was the state type is in `self`.
<!-- trait StateSetExt::fn xor_sets -->
Constructs the exclusive-or of the two sets, returning `None` is empty.
The set returned by this operation contains the states in exactly
one of the two sets.
## `compare_set`
another `StateSet`

# Returns

a new `StateSet` which contains the states
which are in exactly one of the two sets.
<!-- enum StateType -->
The possible types of states of an object
<!-- enum StateType::variant Invalid -->
Indicates an invalid state - probably an error condition.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Active -->
Indicates a window is currently the active window, or an object is the active subelement within a container or table. ATK_STATE_ACTIVE should not be used for objects which have ATK_STATE_FOCUSABLE or ATK_STATE_SELECTABLE: Those objects should use ATK_STATE_FOCUSED and ATK_STATE_SELECTED respectively. ATK_STATE_ACTIVE is a means to indicate that an object which is not focusable and not selectable is the currently-active item within its parent container.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Armed -->
Indicates that the object is 'armed', i.e. will be activated by if a pointer button-release event occurs within its bounds. Buttons often enter this state when a pointer click occurs within their bounds, as a precursor to activation. ATK_STATE_ARMED has been deprecated since ATK-2.16 and should not be used in newly-written code.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Busy -->
Indicates the current object is busy, i.e. onscreen representation is in the process of changing, or the object is temporarily unavailable for interaction due to activity already in progress. This state may be used by implementors of Document to indicate that content loading is underway. It also may indicate other 'pending' conditions; clients may wish to interrogate this object when the ATK_STATE_BUSY flag is removed.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Checked -->
Indicates this object is currently checked, for instance a checkbox is 'non-empty'.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Defunct -->
Indicates that this object no longer has a valid backing widget (for instance, if its peer object has been destroyed)
<!-- enum StateType::variant Editable -->
Indicates that this object can contain text, and that the
user can change the textual contents of this object by editing those contents
directly. For an object which is expected to be editable due to its type, but
which cannot be edited due to the application or platform preventing the user
from doing so, that object's `StateSet` should lack ATK_STATE_EDITABLE and
should contain ATK_STATE_READ_ONLY.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Enabled -->
Indicates that this object is enabled, i.e. that it currently reflects some application state. Objects that are "greyed out" may lack this state, and may lack the STATE_SENSITIVE if direct user interaction cannot cause them to acquire STATE_ENABLED. See also: ATK_STATE_SENSITIVE
<!-- enum StateType::variant Expandable -->
Indicates this object allows progressive disclosure of its children
<!-- enum StateType::variant Expanded -->
Indicates this object its expanded - see ATK_STATE_EXPANDABLE above
<!-- enum StateType::variant Focusable -->
Indicates this object can accept keyboard focus, which means all events resulting from typing on the keyboard will normally be passed to it when it has focus
<!-- enum StateType::variant Focused -->
Indicates this object currently has the keyboard focus
<!-- enum StateType::variant Horizontal -->
Indicates the orientation of this object is horizontal; used, for instance, by objects of ATK_ROLE_SCROLL_BAR. For objects where vertical/horizontal orientation is especially meaningful.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Iconified -->
Indicates this object is minimized and is represented only by an icon
<!-- enum StateType::variant Modal -->
Indicates something must be done with this object before the user can interact with an object in a different window
<!-- enum StateType::variant MultiLine -->
Indicates this (text) object can contain multiple lines of text
<!-- enum StateType::variant Multiselectable -->
Indicates this object allows more than one of its children to be selected at the same time, or in the case of text objects, that the object supports non-contiguous text selections.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Opaque -->
Indicates this object paints every pixel within its rectangular region.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Pressed -->
Indicates this object is currently pressed.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Resizable -->
Indicates the size of this object is not fixed
<!-- enum StateType::variant Selectable -->
Indicates this object is the child of an object that allows its children to be selected and that this child is one of those children that can be selected
<!-- enum StateType::variant Selected -->
Indicates this object is the child of an object that allows its children to be selected and that this child is one of those children that has been selected
<!-- enum StateType::variant Sensitive -->
Indicates this object is sensitive, e.g. to user interaction.
STATE_SENSITIVE usually accompanies STATE_ENABLED for user-actionable controls,
but may be found in the absence of STATE_ENABLED if the current visible state of the
control is "disconnected" from the application state. In such cases, direct user interaction
can often result in the object gaining STATE_SENSITIVE, for instance if a user makes
an explicit selection using an object whose current state is ambiguous or undefined.
`see` STATE_ENABLED, STATE_INDETERMINATE.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Showing -->
Indicates this object, the object's parent, the object's parent's parent, and so on,
are all 'shown' to the end-user, i.e. subject to "exposure" if blocking or obscuring objects do not interpose
between this object and the top of the window stack.
<!-- enum StateType::variant SingleLine -->
Indicates this (text) object can contain only a single line of text
<!-- enum StateType::variant Stale -->
Indicates that the information returned for this object may no longer be
synchronized with the application state. This is implied if the object has STATE_TRANSIENT,
and can also occur towards the end of the object peer's lifecycle. It can also be used to indicate that
the index associated with this object has changed since the user accessed the object (in lieu of
"index-in-parent-changed" events).
<!-- enum StateType::variant Transient -->
Indicates this object is transient, i.e. a snapshot which may not emit events when its
state changes. Data from objects with ATK_STATE_TRANSIENT should not be cached, since there may be no
notification given when the cached data becomes obsolete.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Vertical -->
Indicates the orientation of this object is vertical
<!-- enum StateType::variant Visible -->
Indicates this object is visible, e.g. has been explicitly marked for exposure to the user.
<!-- enum StateType::variant ManagesDescendants -->
Indicates that "active-descendant-changed" event
is sent when children become 'active' (i.e. are selected or navigated to onscreen).
Used to prevent need to enumerate all children in very large containers, like tables.
The presence of STATE_MANAGES_DESCENDANTS is an indication to the client.
that the children should not, and need not, be enumerated by the client.
Objects implementing this state are expected to provide relevant state
notifications to listening clients, for instance notifications of visibility
changes and activation of their contained child objects, without the client
having previously requested references to those children.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Indeterminate -->
Indicates that the value, or some other quantifiable
property, of this AtkObject cannot be fully determined. In the case of a large
data set in which the total number of items in that set is unknown (e.g. 1 of
999+), implementors should expose the currently-known set size (999) along
with this state. In the case of a check box, this state should be used to
indicate that the check box is a tri-state check box which is currently
neither checked nor unchecked.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Truncated -->
Indicates that an object is truncated, e.g. a text value in a speradsheet cell.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Required -->
Indicates that explicit user interaction with an object is required by the user interface, e.g. a required field in a "web-form" interface.
<!-- enum StateType::variant InvalidEntry -->
Indicates that the object has encountered an error condition due to failure of input validation. For instance, a form control may acquire this state in response to invalid or malformed user input.
<!-- enum StateType::variant SupportsAutocompletion -->
Indicates that the object in question implements some form of ¨typeahead¨ or
pre-selection behavior whereby entering the first character of one or more sub-elements
causes those elements to scroll into view or become selected. Subsequent character input
may narrow the selection further as long as one or more sub-elements match the string.
This state is normally only useful and encountered on objects that implement Selection.
In some cases the typeahead behavior may result in full or partial ¨completion¨ of
the data in the input field, in which case these input events may trigger text-changed
events from the AtkText interface. This state supplants `Role::Autocomplete`.
<!-- enum StateType::variant SelectableText -->
Indicates that the object in question supports text selection. It should only be exposed on objects which implement the Text interface, in order to distinguish this state from `StateType::Selectable`, which infers that the object in question is a selectable child of an object which implements Selection. While similar, text selection and subelement selection are distinct operations.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Default -->
Indicates that the object is the "default" active component, i.e. the object which is activated by an end-user press of the "Enter" or "Return" key. Typically a "close" or "submit" button.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Animated -->
Indicates that the object changes its appearance dynamically as an inherent part of its presentation. This state may come and go if an object is only temporarily animated on the way to a 'final' onscreen presentation.
`note` some applications, notably content viewers, may not be able to detect
all kinds of animated content. Therefore the absence of this state should not
be taken as definitive evidence that the object's visual representation is
static; this state is advisory.
<!-- enum StateType::variant Visited -->
Indicates that the object (typically a hyperlink) has already been 'activated', and/or its backing data has already been downloaded, rendered, or otherwise "visited".
<!-- enum StateType::variant Checkable -->
Indicates this object has the potential to be
 checked, such as a checkbox or toggle-able table cell. `Since`:
 ATK-2.12
<!-- enum StateType::variant HasPopup -->
Indicates that the object has a popup context
menu or sub-level menu which may or may not be showing. This means
that activation renders conditional content. Note that ordinary
tooltips are not considered popups in this context. `Since`: ATK-2.12
<!-- enum StateType::variant HasTooltip -->
Indicates this object has a tooltip. `Since`: ATK-2.16
<!-- enum StateType::variant ReadOnly -->
Indicates that a widget which is ENABLED and SENSITIVE
has a value which can be read, but not modified, by the user. Note that this
state should only be applied to widget types whose value is normally directly
user modifiable, such as check boxes, radio buttons, spin buttons, text input
fields, and combo boxes, as a means to convey that the expected interaction
with that widget is not possible. When the expected interaction with a
widget does not include modification by the user, as is the case with
labels and containers, ATK_STATE_READ_ONLY should not be applied. See also
ATK_STATE_EDITABLE. `Since`: ATK-2-16
<!-- enum StateType::variant LastDefined -->
Not a valid state, used for finding end of enumeration
<!-- struct StreamableContent -->
An interface whereby an object allows its backing content to be
streamed to clients. Typical implementors would be images or
icons, HTML content, or multimedia display/rendering widgets.

Negotiation of content type is allowed. Clients may examine the
backing data and transform, convert, or parse the content in order
to present it in an alternate form to end-users.

The AtkStreamableContent interface is particularly useful for
saving, printing, or post-processing entire documents, or for
persisting alternate views of a document. If document content
itself is being serialized, stored, or converted, then use of the
AtkStreamableContent interface can help address performance
issues. Unlike most ATK interfaces, this interface is not strongly
tied to the current user-agent view of the a particular document,
but may in some cases give access to the underlying model data.

# Implements

Trait containing all `StreamableContent` methods.

# Implementors

type is at position 0, the second at position 1, and so on.
## `i`

# Returns

a gchar* representing the specified mime type; the caller
should not free the character string.
<!-- trait StreamableContentExt::fn get_n_mime_types -->
Gets the number of mime types supported by this object.

# Returns

a gint which is the number of mime types supported by the object.
<!-- trait StreamableContentExt::fn get_stream -->
Gets the content in the specified mime type.
## `mime_type`

<!-- trait StreamableContentExt::fn get_uri -->
Get a string representing a URI in IETF standard format
(see http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt) from which the object's content
may be streamed in the specified mime-type, if one is available.
If mime_type is NULL, the URI for the default (and possibly only) mime-type is
returned.

Note that it is possible for get_uri to return NULL but for
get_stream to work nonetheless, since not all GIOChannels connect to URIs.
## `mime_type`
a gchar* representing the mime type, or NULL to request a URI
for the default mime type.

# Returns

Returns a string representing a URI, or `None`
if no corresponding URI can be constructed.
<!-- struct Table -->
`Table` should be implemented by components which present
elements ordered via rows and columns. It may also be used to
present tree-structured information if the nodes of the trees can
be said to contain multiple "columns". Individual elements of an
`Table` are typically referred to as "cells". Those cells should
implement the interface `TableCell`, but `Atk` doesn't require
them to be direct children of the current `Table`. They can be
grand-children, grand-grand-children etc. `Table` provides the
API needed to get a individual cell based on the row and column
numbers.

Children of `Table` are frequently "lightweight" objects, that
is, they may not have backing widgets in the host UI toolkit. They
are therefore often transient.

Since tables are often very complex, `Table` includes provision
for offering simplified summary information, as well as row and
column headers and captions. Headers and captions are `AtkObjects`
which may implement other interfaces (`Text`, `Image`, etc.) as
appropriate. `Table` summaries may themselves be (simplified)
`AtkTables`, etc.

Note for implementors: in the past, `Table` required that all the
cells should be direct children of `Table`, and provided some
index based methods to request the cells. The practice showed that
that forcing made `Table` implementation complex, and hard to
expose other kind of children, like rows or captions. Right now,
index-based methods are deprecated.

<!-- struct Text -->
`Text` should be implemented by `AtkObjects` on behalf of widgets
that have text content which is either attributed or otherwise
non-trivial. `AtkObjects` whose text content is simple,
unattributed, and very brief may expose that content via
`AtkObjectExt::get_name` instead; however if the text is editable,
multi-line, typically longer than three or four words, attributed,
selectable, or if the object already uses the 'name' ATK property
for other information, the `Text` interface should be used to
expose the text content. In the case of editable text content,
`EditableText` (a subtype of the `Text` interface) should be
implemented instead.

 `Text` provides not only traversal facilities and change
notification for text content, but also caret tracking and glyph
bounding box calculations. Note that the text strings are exposed
as UTF-8, and are therefore potentially multi-byte, and
caret-to-byte offset mapping makes no assumptions about the
character length; also bounding box glyph-to-offset mapping may be
complex for languages which use ligatures.

<!-- trait TextExt::fn get_string_at_offset -->
Gets a portion of the text exposed through an `Text` according to a given `offset`
and a specific `granularity`, along with the start and end offsets defining the
boundaries of such a portion of text.

If `granularity` is ATK_TEXT_GRANULARITY_CHAR the character at the
offset is returned.

If `granularity` is ATK_TEXT_GRANULARITY_WORD the returned string
is from the word start at or before the offset to the word start after
the offset.

The returned string will contain the word at the offset if the offset
is inside a word and will contain the word before the offset if the
offset is not inside a word.

If `granularity` is ATK_TEXT_GRANULARITY_SENTENCE the returned string
is from the sentence start at or before the offset to the sentence
start after the offset.

The returned string will contain the sentence at the offset if the offset
is inside a sentence and will contain the sentence before the offset
if the offset is not inside a sentence.

If `granularity` is ATK_TEXT_GRANULARITY_LINE the returned string
is from the line start at or before the offset to the line
start after the offset.

If `granularity` is ATK_TEXT_GRANULARITY_PARAGRAPH the returned string
is from the start of the paragraph at or before the offset to the start
of the following paragraph after the offset.

Gets the specified text.

If the boundary_type if ATK_TEXT_BOUNDARY_CHAR the character at the
offset is returned.

If the boundary_type is ATK_TEXT_BOUNDARY_WORD_START the returned string
is from the word start at or before the offset to the word start after
the offset.

The returned string will contain the word at the offset if the offset
is inside a word and will contain the word before the offset if the
offset is not inside a word.

If the boundary type is ATK_TEXT_BOUNDARY_SENTENCE_START the returned
string is from the sentence start at or before the offset to the sentence
start after the offset.

The returned string will contain the sentence at the offset if the offset

# Implements

[`glib::object::ObjectExt`](../glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html)
<!-- struct Value -->
`Value` should be implemented for components which either display
a value from a bounded range, or which allow the user to specify a
value from a bounded range, or both. For instance, most sliders and
range controls, as well as dials, should have `Object`
representations which implement `Value` on the component's
behalf. `AtKValues` may be read-only, in which case attempts to
alter the value return would fail.

<refsect1 id="current-value-text">
`<title>`On the subject of current value text`</title>`
`<para>`
In addition to providing the current value, implementors can
optionally provide an end-user-consumable textual description
associated with this value. This description should be included
when the numeric value fails to convey the full, on-screen
representation seen by users.
`</para>`

`<example>`
`<title>`Password strength`</title>`
A password strength meter whose value changes as the user types
their new password. Red is used for values less than 4.0, yellow
for values between 4.0 and 7.0, and green for values greater than
7.0. In this instance, value text should be provided by the
implementor. Appropriate value text would be "weak", "acceptable,"
and "strong" respectively.
`</example>`

A level bar whose value changes to reflect the battery charge. The
color remains the same regardless of the charge and there is no
on-screen text reflecting the fullness of the battery. In this
case, because the position within the bar is the only indication
the user has of the current charge, value text should not be
provided by the implementor.

<refsect2 id="implementor-notes">
`<title>`Implementor Notes`</title>`
`<para>`
Implementors should bear in mind that assistive technologies will
likely prefer the value text provided over the numeric value when
presenting a widget's value. As a result, strings not intended for
end users should not be exposed in the value text, and strings
which are exposed should be localized. In the case of widgets which
display value text on screen, for instance through a separate label
in close proximity to the value-displaying widget, it is still
expected that implementors will expose the value text using the
above API.
`</para>`

`<para>`
`Value` should NOT be implemented for widgets whose displayed
value is not reflective of a meaningful amount. For instance, a
progress pulse indicator whose value alternates between 0.0 and 1.0
to indicate that some process is still taking place should not
implement `Value` because the current value does not reflect
progress towards completion.
`</para>`
`</refsect2>`
`</refsect1>`

<refsect1 id="ranges">
`<title>`On the subject of ranges`</title>`
`<para>`
In addition to providing the minimum and maximum values,
implementors can optionally provide details about subranges
associated with the widget. These details should be provided by the
implementor when both of the following are communicated visually to
the end user:
`</para>`
`<itemizedlist>`
 `<listitem>`The existence of distinct ranges such as "weak",
 "acceptable", and "strong" indicated by color, bar tick marks,
 and/or on-screen text.`</listitem>`
 `<listitem>`Where the current value stands within a given subrange,
 for instance illustrating progression from very "weak" towards
 nearly "acceptable" through changes in shade and/or position on
 the bar within the "weak" subrange.`</listitem>`
`</itemizedlist>`
`<para>`
If both of the above do not apply to the widget, it should be
sufficient to expose the numeric value, along with the value text
if appropriate, to make the widget accessible.
`</para>`

<refsect2 id="ranges-implementor-notes">
`<title>`Implementor Notes`</title>`
`<para>`
If providing subrange details is deemed necessary, all possible
values of the widget are expected to fall within one of the
subranges defined by the implementor.
`</para>`
`</refsect2>`
`</refsect1>`

<refsect1 id="localization">
`<title>`On the subject of localization of end-user-consumable text
values`</title>`
`<para>`
Because value text and subrange descriptors are human-consumable,
implementors are expected to provide localized strings which can be
directly presented to end users via their assistive technology. In
order to simplify this for implementors, implementors can use
`ValueType::get_localized_name` with the following
already-localized constants for commonly-needed values can be used:
`</para>`

`<itemizedlist>`
 `<listitem>`ATK_VALUE_VERY_WEAK`</listitem>`
 `<listitem>`ATK_VALUE_WEAK`</listitem>`
 `<listitem>`ATK_VALUE_ACCEPTABLE`</listitem>`
 `<listitem>`ATK_VALUE_STRONG`</listitem>`
 `<listitem>`ATK_VALUE_VERY_STRONG`</listitem>`
 `<listitem>`ATK_VALUE_VERY_LOW`</listitem>`
 `<listitem>`ATK_VALUE_LOW`</listitem>`
 `<listitem>`ATK_VALUE_MEDIUM`</listitem>`
 `<listitem>`ATK_VALUE_HIGH`</listitem>`
 `<listitem>`ATK_VALUE_VERY_HIGH`</listitem>`
 `<listitem>`ATK_VALUE_VERY_BAD`</listitem>`
 `<listitem>`ATK_VALUE_BAD`</listitem>`
 `<listitem>`ATK_VALUE_GOOD`</listitem>`
 `<listitem>`ATK_VALUE_VERY_GOOD`</listitem>`
 `<listitem>`ATK_VALUE_BEST`</listitem>`
 `<listitem>`ATK_VALUE_SUBSUBOPTIMAL`</listitem>`
 `<listitem>`ATK_VALUE_SUBOPTIMAL`</listitem>`
 `<listitem>`ATK_VALUE_OPTIMAL`</listitem>`
`</itemizedlist>`
`<para>`
Proposals for additional constants, along with their use cases,
should be submitted to the GNOME Accessibility Team.
`</para>`
`</refsect1>`

<refsect1 id="changes">
`<title>`On the subject of changes`</title>`
`<para>`
Note that if there is a textual description associated with the new
numeric value, that description should be included regardless of
whether or not it has also changed.
`</para>`
`</refsect1>`

instead.
## `value`
a `gobject::Value` representing the current accessible value
<!-- trait ValueExt::fn get_increment -->
Gets the minimum increment by which the value of this object may be
changed. If zero, the minimum increment is undefined, which may
mean that it is limited only by the floating point precision of the
platform.

# Returns

the minimum increment by which the value of this
object may be changed. zero if undefined.
<!-- trait ValueExt::fn get_maximum_value -->
Gets the maximum value of this object.

# Deprecated

## `value`
a `gobject::Value` representing the minimum accessible value
<!-- trait ValueExt::fn get_range -->
Gets the range of this object.

# Returns

a newly allocated `Range`
that represents the minimum, maximum and descriptor (if available)
of `self`. NULL if that range is not defined.
<!-- trait ValueExt::fn get_sub_ranges -->
Gets the list of subranges defined for this object. See `Value`
introduction for examples of subranges and when to expose them.

# Returns

an `glib::SList` of
`Range` which each of the subranges defined for this object. Free
the returns list with `glib::SList::free`.
<!-- trait ValueExt::fn get_value_and_text -->
Gets the current value and the human readable text alternative of
`self`. `text` is a newly created string, that must be freed by the
caller. Can be NULL if no descriptor is available.
## `value`
address of `gdouble` to put the current value of `self`
## `text`
address of `gchar` to put the human

## `value`
a `gobject::Value` which is the desired new accessible value.

# Returns

`true` if new value is successfully set, `false` otherwise.
<!-- trait ValueExt::fn set_value -->
Sets the value of this object.

This method is intended to provide a way to change the value of the
object. In any case, it is possible that the value can't be
modified (ie: a read-only component). If the value changes due this
call, it is possible that the text could change, and will trigger
an `Value::value-changed` signal emission.

Note for implementors: the deprecated `Value::set_current_value`
method returned TRUE or FALSE depending if the value was assigned
or not. In the practice several implementors were not able to
decide it, and returned TRUE in any case. For that reason it is not
required anymore to return if the value was properly assigned or
not.
## `new_value`
a double which is the desired new accessible value.
<!-- trait ValueExt::fn connect_value_changed -->
The 'value-changed' signal is emitted when the current value
that represent the object changes. `value` is the numerical
representation of this new value. `text` is the human
readable text alternative of `value`, and can be NULL if it is
not available. Note that if there is a textual description
associated with the new numeric value, that description
should be included regardless of whether or not it has also
changed.

Example: a password meter whose value changes as the user
types their new password. Appropiate value text would be
"weak", "acceptable" and "strong".
## `value`
the new value in a numerical form.
## `text`
human readable text alternative (also called
description) of this object. NULL if not available.
<!-- enum ValueType -->
Default types for a given value. Those are defined in order to
